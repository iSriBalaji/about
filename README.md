Hey Guys! As part of the course that I've enrolled on Udemy I've started developing this simple webpage and gradually updated by styling certain things using CSS. Even it looks simple it took me hours to learn all those things. I've tried front end development when I was doing a course at NIIT. Unfortuneatly I couldn't continue it.But, I started it again.
